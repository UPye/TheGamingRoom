# TheGamingRoom

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
My client, The Gaming Room, wanted their game, Draw It or Lose It ( similar to games like Super Draw), to be designed and developed so that it can operate on various platforms. Therefore, I developed the code with plenty of commentation, in case of any further developments of the game. 

When working through the included design document, it was most helpful to include the visual UML diagram, in the design model section, since it allowed for the visual representaion of how the classes intereacted with each other. This made it easier to see what traits needed to be made public or private making them more accessible. When designing this application for all platforms, Java was used since it can be used to develop applications on all platforms. I was able to include documentation of what each block of code does for scaleability. Thus, cutting down on their need for outside help and making the application readable for anyone to assist them further.

When completing the design software I began at the beginning, with the source code. From there I looked over what the client wanted implemented into the code. Then, I chose Java since it can be altered to work on any platform. I then constructed the implementations into the application based upon the flow of the design template. I will use this technique in the future because it organized the application at face value and what needed to be done to it to satisfy the client.
